Practical 2 : INPUT MARKS SCORED IN FDS & PERFORM OPERATIONS : Write a Python program to store marks scored in subject “Fundamental of Data Structure” by N students in the class. Write functions to compute following : 
<br>a) The average score of class
<br>b) Highest score and lowest score of class
<br>c) Count of students who were absent for the test
<br>d) Display mark with highest frequency

Practical 5 : STRING OPERATIONS : Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
<br>a)	To display word with the longest length
<br>b)	To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
<br>c)	To check whether given string is palindrome or not
<br>d)	To display index of first appearance of the substring
<br>e)	To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

Practical 9 : MATRIX OPERATIONS : Write a Python program to compute following computation on matrix:

<br>b) Subtraction of two matrices
<br>c) Multiplication of two matrices 
<br>d) Transpose of a matrix

**GROUP - B**

Practical 12 : BINARY SEARCH & FIBONACCI SEARCH
<br>a)	Write a Python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted order on names. Search your friend from list using binary search (recursive and non- recursive). Insert friend if not present in phonebook
<br>b)	Write a Python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted order on names. Search your friend from list using Fibonacci search. Insert friend if not present in phonebook.
