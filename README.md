<br>a) The average score of class
<br>b) Highest score and lowest score of class
<br>c) Count of students who were absent for the test
<br>d) Display mark with highest frequency

Practical 5 : STRING OPERATIONS : Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:
<br>a)	To display word with the longest length
<br>b)	To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string
<br>c)	To check whether given string is palindrome or not
<br>d)	To display index of first appearance of the substring
<br>e)	To count the occurrences of each word in a given string

**GROUP - B**

Practical 12 : BINARY SEARCH & FIBONACCI SEARCH
<br>a)	Write a Python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted order on names. Search your friend from list using binary search (recursive and non- recursive). Insert friend if not present in phonebook
<br>b)	Write a Python program to store names and mobile numbers of your friends in sorted order on names. Search your friend from list using Fibonacci search. Insert friend if not present in phonebook.

Practical 14 : SORTING TECHNIQUES : Write a Python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
<br>a)	Selection Sort
<br>b)	Bubble sort and display top five scores.

**GROUP - C**

Practical 19 : Department of Computer Engineering has student's club named 'Pinnacle Club'. Students of second, third and final year of department can be granted membership on request. Similarly one may cancel the membership of club. First node is reserved for president of club and last node is reserved for secretary of club. Write C++ program to maintain club member‘s information using singly linked list. Store student PRN and Name. Write functions to:
a)	Add and delete the members as well as president or even secretary.
b)	Compute total number of members of club
c)	Display members
d)	Two linked lists exists for two divisions. Concatenate two lists.


Practical 15 : SORTING TECHNIQUES : Write a Python program to store second year percentage of students in array. Write function for sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using
